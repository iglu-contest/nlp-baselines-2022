# nlp-baselines-2022
The repository contains the tope performing NLP solutions for IGLU 2022 competition. The baselines cover solutions to **When** and **What** to ask as clarification questions. 
For more details about the baselines, we refer to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10783). 

## When to ask
Here, we have two baselines:

1. Text-Grid Cross Modularity

2. **Textual Grid world State**:

[This directory](https://github.com/iglu-contest/nlp-baselines-2022/tree/main/classifiers/Textual%20Grid%20world%20State%20Baseline) includes the related material to this baseline. You can use [train.ipynb](https://github.com/iglu-contest/nlp-baselines-2022/blob/main/classifiers/Textual%20Grid%20world%20State%20Baseline/train.ipynb)  to train the model yourself. In case you do not want to go through training, you can [download the trained models from here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11F_m8Qihv8AMZlfrr4P0-zrQOjPC8bnT?usp=drive_link) and run [test.py](https://github.com/iglu-contest/nlp-baselines-2022/blob/main/classifiers/Textual%20Grid%20world%20State%20Baseline/test.py) for inference purpose.
